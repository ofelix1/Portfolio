### Projects

ERCOT DART Webscraper 

* This is a tool I’ve built to scrape and display data from ERCOT. It’s a GUI-based application that handles real-time (RT) prices, day-ahead market (DAM) prices, and settlement data.The GUI was built using Tkinter, and real-time data was retrieved through web scraping with BeautifulSoup

Weather 7 Day Forcast Model

* Developed a Weather App using Python and Tkinter that retrieves real-time weather information and 4-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input of city and country. Implemented GUI (Graphical User Interface) to display the weather data and provide options for users to choose between real-time weather and the 7-day forecast. The information is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis.
